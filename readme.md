Module 002 - Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu

In this FreeCodeCamp project, I deepened my understanding of basic CSS by constructing a caf√© menu. This endeavor involved employing fundamental HTML structures and CSS styling to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional webpage.

Key HTML Elements Used:

Structural Elements: <div>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>. These elements helped in organizing the content logically.
Heading Elements: <h1>, <h2>. Used for the main title and section titles, respectively.
Paragraph Element <p>: Utilized for descriptive text like item names and prices.
Image Element <img>: Included to add visual appeal with relevant icons.
Hyperlink Element <a>: To provide a link to the FreeCodeCamp website.
Meta Tags: In the <head> section, ensuring proper character set and responsive design.

CSS Styling Highlights:

Background Styling: Applied a background image to the body for thematic consistency.
Font Styling: Usage of sans-serif and Impact font families for readability and impact.
Text Alignment: Centered text for headings and paragraphs for a neat layout.
Box Model: Implementation of margins, padding, and width to define spacing and size of elements.
Inline-Block Display: Used for menu items to align flavors and prices side by side.
Color and Hover Effects: Styled hyperlinks for interactivity and visual feedback.
Responsive Design Principles: Ensured the menu's aesthetic integrity across different devices with responsive units and media queries (not shown in the provided code but an essential part of modern web design).

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in using CSS to enhance the visual presentation of web content. I learned to use various CSS properties to improve typography, layout, and overall user experience. This project exemplifies my growing ability to create web pages that are not only functional but also visually appealing.
